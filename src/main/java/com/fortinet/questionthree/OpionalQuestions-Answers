Question - 3:

a) What is Session in Hibernate?

The  hibernate architecture has many objects and session is one of them.
A session object represents a database connection and once we have a Session
object we can perform all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update,Delete ) operation.
We can get a session by calling an open session  method of the SessionFactory
interface.The object which is not passed to the save method of the session then
such object is called as transient object. After we save the object using the save
method of the session then such object becomes persistent and once we close the session
then such object goes in detached state i.e this object is not associated with the session.
